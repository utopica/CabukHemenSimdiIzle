## Problems We Had Experienced
 -At the outset of the project, we encountered challenges related to task allocation and meeting some features' deadlines due to the external commitments of some team members. However, we successfully overcame these issues by facilitating more frequent gatherings among the team members and enhancing communication through channels such as Discord and other messaging platforms. While we may not have initially achieved some of the set goals in the project's early stages, we are planning to elevate the project to a higher level in the ongoing process, aligning with the objectives we have defined below. We extend our gratitude to all the dedicated team members who have contributed.

## Potential Project Additions Ahead


-To enhance user experience, individual folders for each user to save their favorite films will be created.
  
-In order to provide insights into the overall performance of the platform, site-wide statistics will be added. Additionally, user ratings for films will be calculated and displayed.

-For easy sharing and embedding of films on external platforms, embedded film links will be generated for each movie.
